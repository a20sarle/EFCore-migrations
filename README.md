Database using EF Core Code First
# Init

## Requirements for updating database using migrations
- ~~```context.Database.Migrate();``` must be used in the builder / Startup.cs file.~~  Don't use ```context.Database.Migrate();```, fails silently. ```EnsureCreated()``` does not create the database based on the migration history and therefore it doesn't let the database to be updated using migrations [1].
- The database needs to have one table storing all the migrations, the autogenerated file is called "__EFMigrationsHistory".
- Install EF Core command-line tools using `Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools` in Package Manager Console [2] to manage migrations from CLI [3].

## Create a EFMigrationshistory table in the database
1. <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/cli/powershell">Install Entity Framework Core tools</a> using command `Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools` in Package Manager Console whic hcan be found in Visual Studio > Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Packet Manager Console.
2. Build the database using code first (minimal requirements is to have one context and one model)
3. Run command `Add-Migration` and check that the autogenerated snapshots of the migration are correct according to the wanted databse structure.
4. Run command `Update-Database` and manually check that the database have been updated and that a table called "__EFMigrationsHistory" has been created.
